Parser for Integer BASIC
==========================

![unit tests](https://github.com/dfgordon/tree-sitter-integerbasic/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

This is the node binding for `tree-sitter-integerbasic`.  See the main README [here](https://github.com/dfgordon/tree-sitter-integerbasic).

Package was deprecated due to the indefinite status of [node-tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/node-tree-sitter), but perhaps can be brought back.

For now use the WASM binding instead.
